*"Having fun with AWS Lambda"*


## About:
This goal of this project is learn more about Python and AWS Lambdas.  Currently this Lambda is triggered by a Slackbot but it could pivot or evolve into anything.

## Requirements:
* Python 3 (tested with Python 3.6.5)
* [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation) and [Virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html")
* [python-lambda](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda#getting-started) (A toolkit for developing and deploying serverless Python code in AWS Lambda.)

## Usage:


## Additional Configurations:
* [Setting Environment Variables](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda#environment-variables)
* [Wiring an API Endpoint](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda#wiring-to-an-api-endpoint)
* [Uploading to S3](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda#uploading-to-s3)
* [Deploying via S3](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda#deploying-via-s3)
